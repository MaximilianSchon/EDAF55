### Filip Borglund

The project has been very rewarding in terms of learning about real time systems. We started off by dividing us into two groups. One group for the client side and one group for the server side. Splitting us into these teams worked very well as we could split up the workload and make parallell progress. However, finishing the first iteration of the project only took us a couple of hours and after that we had a hard time dividing up the work in a good way. We ended up working on trying to put the two parts of the project together, all four of us. After the first iteration of coding, I believe we could have kept dividing tasks in a better way to utilize our full capacity.

### Sepehr Noorzadeh

The project taught me a lot about how real time systems are implemented, specifically how the ideas from the design are concretely implemented in the code, and the challenges that it poses. Thanks to the good design we had from the beginning, we didn't need to change much and coming up with the implementations as a team, using 'couch-programming', was actually a lot of fun. One difficulty was that we had slightly differing ideas of how some of the features specified in the spec were supposed to work. If we had to do it all over again, I'd make sure that all the members had the same ideas about the program before starting to implement the features.

### Maximilian Schön

The project has taught me more about how to work together in a group, how to plan more in detail and helped me understand some concurrent concepts more concretely. I found the major difficulties in using the data structures that Java offered correctly. For example we had some problems with the ObjectInputStream filling up and throwing a StackOverFlowException after a while, once we figured out which methods to use it worked out. If I would do the project again, I would make sure to look up which methods was blocking - and also how the classes we used worked in more detail. 

### Keiwan Mosaddegh

This project was extremely interesting to be a part of, and I couldn't be more grateful for my team members, and the solid team work we were able to have throughout 4 intense, but rewarding weeks. We had a great start. Due to great planning from the beginning and a solid, and approved design, we were able to accomplish the majority of the work in our first 4 hour sitting. The next sittings were spent creating the additional features of the project requirements, and rethinking and optimizing our previous implementations. If we'd do it all over again, we'd make sure we were more in par about what purpose our implementations would have.
